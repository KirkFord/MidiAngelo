midi tempo adjuster takes:
a string name for the midi file inputted.
a string name for the newly created midi output.
a float that is greater than 0 as the factor in which to speed up/ slow down.

example:
python midi_tempo_adjuster.py 'filein.mid' 'fileout.mid' 0.50


midi to audio conversion takes:

a string name representing the soundbank being used for the conversion (i took the liberty of just adding the "soundbanks/" part of the name to the code itself).
a string name representing the name of the midi file we wish to use with the soundbank.
a string name representing the name of the outputted .wav file we would like to save the conversion as.

example:
python midi_to_audio_conversion.py 'Recorder.sf2' 'filein.mid' 'output.wav'


audio volume adjuster takes:

a string name representing the .wav file inputted.
a string name representing the .wav file output after audio adjustment.
an integer (other than zero). Positive integers will make the .wav louder, while negative integers will make the .wav quieter.

example:
python audio_volume_adjuster.py 'output.wav' 'output_volume.wav' 25
